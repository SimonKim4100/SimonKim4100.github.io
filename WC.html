                <p>Program that fetches student class information in ERP, using Selenium, cookies, requests, and basic excel funtions. 
                    Was made for personal use because the monthly report took far too long without an automated system. 
                    Unfortunately, it was not implemented as an official system. 
                    The program automatically fills in the excel file below with the data fetched from the academy's ERP.
